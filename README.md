# Project 2
In this project, you will implement a simple "social network". You will practice using ArrayLists, reading from the file and writing to a file, as well as using the Comparable interface. 
You will also strengthen your understanding of object-oriented design as this assignment has objects of several classes interacting with each other. See Canvas for the description.
